**The Humanities** **Department** **aims to:** 

*   Inculcate in Marists a love for the Humanities subjects; and   
    
*   Develop Marists to be critical and independent thinkers prepared to face the globalised world while remaining rooted in Singapore.

  

**To achieve the Department's goals, the following programmes are offered:**

*   Lower Secondary Humanities (History & Geography)  
    
*   Upper Secondary Humanities (Social Studies, Elective Geography & History, Geography & History)  
    

We adopt an Inquiry-Based Learning Approach in our teaching of the Humanities. It consists of four main areas of inquiry:

In the study of Humanities, our students are actively engaged in inquiry. This is best seen in a component called Geographical & Historical Investigations (GI and HI respectively).  

  

In addition, we work with the Student Development Committee to come up with a series of Learning Journeys that have their anchor in Humanities topics and concepts. Some of the Learning Journeys we have completed include:

*   NEWater Learning Journey  
    
*   Madame Tussauds Museum  
    
*   Resilience Trails  
    
*   Parliament House Visits  
    

  

**Marists are given the opportunities to participate in the following competitions:**  

*   Mock United Nations Conferences  
    
*   National Stamp Competition  
    
*   Raffles Humanities Competition  
    
*   NUS Geography Challenge  
    
*   Tourism Competition
