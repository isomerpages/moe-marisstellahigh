<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What is the 2024 PSLE score for admission into Maris Stella?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the new PSLE scoring system, the cut-off points in 2024 are AL
11 for non-affiliated students and AL 16 for affiliated students.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Are only 20% of the schoolâ€™s places available for non-affiliated students?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 2019, MOE has reserved 20% of all places in secondary schools with
affiliated primary schools for non-affiliated students. Our affiliated
students typically take up about 30-35% of the Secondary 1 intake. Hence,
there is still a significant proportion of places for non-affiliated students.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Must my son/ward take Higher Chinese/Chinese Language to enter Maris Stella
High School?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With effect from 2025, a student who wishes to pursue his education in
Maris Stella High School must offer HCL as his Mother Tongue language.
Students need not have to take HCL in P6 to be admitted to the school.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Must my son/ward be a Catholic to join the school?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students of all faiths are welcome to join Maris Stella High School. About
80-85% of our secondary students are non-Catholic. For Catholic students,
Spiritual Formation programmes are offered. Non-Catholic students are not
required, but are welcome, to attend these programmes.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>I wish to appeal to transfer my son/ward into Secondary 1. How do I do
so?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on MOE policy, only students who meet the cut-off point during the
posting year may be considered by the school for appeal to transfer into
the school.</p>
<p>The appeal process will be made known via our school website nearer to
the release of the Secondary 1 posting results. We are accepting appeal
only via online submission. Only shortlisted candidates will be asked to
come to the school for an interview.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How do I apply to the school via Direct Schools Admission (DSA)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DSA application typically begins around May every year. Updated details
will be published on the Ministry of Education website, as well as our
school website, closer to that period.</p>
<h4>ACADEMIC</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Must my son/ward take Higher Chinese Language while in the school?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At Secondary 1, all of our students are to take Higher Chinese Language.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Can my son/ward choose to drop Higher Chinese if he cannot cope with the
subject?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, he can. However, students who have started Higher Chinese Language
in Secondary 1 are to continue doing so until Secondary 3, where they will
take the O-Level Chinese Language examination, before making a decision
to continue or not. This is because learning a language takes time.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
