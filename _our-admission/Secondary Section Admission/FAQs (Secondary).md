<p>Since 2019, MOE has reserved 20% of all places in secondary schools with
affiliated primary schools for non-affiliated students. Our affiliated
students typically take up about 30-35% of the Secondary 1 intake. Hence,
there is still a significant proportion of places for non-affiliated students.</p>
