**National Day 2018 Celebrations**

On 8 August 2018, both the primary and secondary sections came together for our combined National Day Parade. The morning rain did not  
dampen our spirits and we started off the day with a sing-along session at our respective school hall, in anticipation of clear weather. The primary students enjoyed the performance put up by the Singapore Agents and joined them for the dance to this year’s theme song while the secondary students had their sing-along session and a segment on “Don’t forget the lyrics – The National Day edition”.  
  
The whole school headed outdoors as soon as the skies were clear and began our Observance Ceremony. The March Past was led by the Scouts, followed by St John’s Brigade, National Police Cadet Corps and National Cadet Corps (Sea). Marists showed their love for Singapore with the proud recitation of the pledge and singing of the National Anthem. After the school song, recitation of the Marist creed and saying our prayer for the nation, Marists with one voice responded to the narration for the Recollections in all seriousness and in a somber tone.  
  
Next, came the fun and exciting part! Marists were treated to a joint display by the martial arts teams from Taekwondo and Wushu who showed us their impressive agile moves. The National Cadet Corps (Sea) used brightly coloured foldable fans to put up a freestyle performance. The Festive Drums, further added to the celebratory atmosphere and ended off the segment with a big bang!  
  
For the finale, the Singapore Agents joined the Band for a rendition of Marists’ all-time favourite National Day song, “Home”. The Singapore Agents and all Primary 5 students then led the whole school to engage in the action version of “We Are Singapore”, with the whole school dancing to the upbeat tune. It was indeed a great way to end off the combined celebrations this year!

On 15 February 2018, teacher and student representatives from our school attended the 51st War Memorial Service in commemoration of the civilian victims of the Japanese Occupation and the Total Defence Day Commemoration event. The event was graced by President Halimah Yaacob, who emphasized the importance of staying resilient in times of crisis. The “All Clear” siren was sounded by the Singapore Civil Defence Force after the President’s speech, followed by silent prayers led by religious representatives from the Inter-Religious Organisation and the observation of a minute of silence. Representatives from SCCCI, business and clan associations, uniformed groups, schools and the Singapore Armed Forces Veterans League took turns to pay their respects. Joshua Law Bing Han of Secondary 3H was one of the student representatives selected to jointly lay a wreath for the ceremony. The event was a meaningful learning experience for the students as their participation in this solemn event reminded them to cherish peace and freedom and reaffirmed the importance of Total Defence.
