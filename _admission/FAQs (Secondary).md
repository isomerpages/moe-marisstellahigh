##### ADMISSION
1. What is the 2023 PSLE score for admission into Maris Stella?

Based on the new PSLE scoring system, the cut-off points in 2022 are AL 14(Pass) for non-affiliated students and AL 16 for affiliated students.
###### Higher Chinese grades: D for Distinction, M for Merit, and P for Pass.

2. Are only 20% of the schoolâ€™s places available for non-affiliated students?

Since 2019, MOE has reserved 20% of all places in secondary schools with affiliated primary schools for non-affiliated students. Our affiliated students typically take up about 30-35% of the Secondary 1 intake. Hence, there is still a significant proportion of places for non-affiliated students.

3. Must my son/ward take Higher Chinese/Chinese Language to enter Maris Stella High School?

With effect from 2025, a student who wishes to pursue his education in Maris Stella High School must offer HCL as his Mother Tongue language. Students need not have to take HCL in P6 to be admitted to the school.

4. Must my son/ward be a Catholic to join the school?

Students of all faiths are welcome to join Maris Stella High School. About 80-85% of our secondary students are non-Catholic.
For Catholic students, Spiritual Formation programmes are offered. Non-Catholic students are not required, but are welcome, to attend these programmes.

5. I wish to appeal to transfer my son/ward into Secondary 1. How do I do so?

Based on MOE policy, only students who meet the cut-off point during the posting year may be considered by the school for appeal to transfer into the school.

The appeal process will be made known via our school website nearer to the release of the Secondary 1 posting results. We are accepting appeal only via online submission. Only shortlisted candidates will be asked to come to the school for an interview.

6. How do I apply to the school via Direct Schools Admission (DSA)?

DSA application typically begins around May every year. Updated details will be published on the Ministry of Education website, as well as our school website, closer to that period.


##### ACADEMIC


7. Must my son/ward take Higher Chinese Language while in the school?

At Secondary 1, all of our students are offered the chance to take Higher Chinese Language. While the school offers the option to do so, it is not compulsory and a student may indicate his preference of taking either Higher Chinese Language or Chinese Language.

8. Can my son/ward choose to drop Higher Chinese if he cannot cope with the subject?

Yes, he can. However, students who have started Higher Chinese Language in Secondary 1 are encouraged to continue doing so until Secondary 3, where they will take the O-Level Chinese Language examination, before making a decision to continue or not. This is because learning a language takes time.

9. Does the school offer Posting Group 1 or 2 courses of study?

No, the school offers only the Posting Group 3 courses of study.

10. Does the school have Subject-Based Banding? 

As our school offers only Posting Group 3 courses of study, we do not have Subject-Based Banding.
