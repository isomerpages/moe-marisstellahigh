The school’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme aim to nurture Marists into Gentlemen of Faith, Vision and Service. Our flagship programme, The Marcellin Way, is a 10-year programme that serves to provide a holistic education for the Marists. The Marcellin Way embodies the meaningful programmes and students outcomes we seek to achieve through the school-wide CCE. These outcomes are derived from the Marist Values of Presence, Simplicity, Family Spirit, Love of Work and In the Way of Mary. These values were distilled in the life and experiences of Saint Marcellin Champagnat, who founded the Marist Brothers in 1817. As Marists, our young gentlemen are nurtured to live by the principle of upholding the Marist Values and school motto,  勤   勉   忠   勇.
