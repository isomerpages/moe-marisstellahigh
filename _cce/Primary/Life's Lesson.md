# Life's Lesson

![](/images/CCE/Primary/good%20wheelchair%203.jpg)

On 8 November 2017, as part of the Project CARE programme, 34 of us, P6 Marists, visited the Saint Theresa’s Home, a Nursing Home for the elderly, established in 1935 by the Little Sisters of the Poor.

  

Before the visit, we had to learn some Cantonese so that we would be able to converse with the elderly folks at the home. We also had to learn how to hold a decent conversation with a stranger. We met and discussed as a team on what activities we could possibly conduct for the elderly. So how did our visit go?

  

Our mission that day was to bring joy to the elderly, through love and service. Firstly, we played Bingo with the elderly. The elderly found it challenging to spot the numbers because of their failing eyesight and we had to help them with this. The winners were REALLY happy.

  

It was very humbling to see such a BRIGHT smile on the crinkly face of an elderly when they got hold of a packet drink and biscuit. It made me think how simple their lives were and how complicated I had made my life to be. Our team of Marists made sure all the elderly were winners eventually! We really wanted everyone in the room to be happy. 

  

We then served the elderly ice-cream, bananas and grapes. Many of the elderly were delighted with the ice cream. This was no expensive ice cream, just the usual POTONG stick ice-cream from NTUC. Once again, I was humbled by how the little things in life could make them so happy.

  

After eating, we played more games with the elderly. Now, this was challenging. Despite our efforts, we did struggle in keeping the elderly engaged as they were very tired and sleepy in the humid afternoon. They could not completely understand us despite our best efforts to speak Cantonese. We persevered though, trying our best to make the elderly smile.

  

At this point in time, my friends who had volunteered to clean the wheelchairs were back in the activity room. Their PE T-shirts were plastered to their bodies, and they were drenched in sweat as they had been working really hard under the hot sun to wash and dry the wheelchairs for the elderly. I was impressed by their determination. They did not utter a single word of complaint. Instead, they kept asking me if they could also help out.

  

I got to push some of the elderly on their wheelchairs, around the home, for some fresh air. I was surprised that the elderly, though not in the pink of health, were actively involved in growing the vegetables they consumed in the Home’s garden. I was inspired by their fierce commitment and independence.

  

It was indeed an afternoon well spent. I could have just simply stayed at home and play games on my mobile phone or watch television, but I am glad I did not.

  

Many of the elderly are ill and lonely. They needed their wheelchairs to move about. They did not seem to get many visitors and were visibly happy to see young people like us visiting them. The visit to the Home has helped me appreciate what I have. I should not take my health and the people around me for granted. I am more determined to lead a healthy life in order to stay healthy and I will appreciate my family. I think we should never ever put our parents in an elderly home.

  

It was unfortunate that we could only spend 2 hours at the Home. If it had been longer, I am sure we would all benefit even more from the collective wisdom of the elderly. They have a wealth of real-life experiences to share with us.

  

I would like to end my sharing by encouraging all of you to participate actively whenever you are invited by your teachers to volunteer your time and service to help the less fortunate around us. I am happy that I had the chance to live out the Marist Creed, by giving love and service to others. I hope you will get a chance to do so too.
