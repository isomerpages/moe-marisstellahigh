The Student Management Committee aims to:  

<u>Discipline and Well-being</u>  

*   Partner and empower colleagues, parents, and partners in society to groom socially responsible Marists;  
    
*   Provide a safe, secure and conducive learning by adopting sound, transparent and consistent processes and procedures; and  
    
*   Educate Marists through values-based and positive discipline in order to groom them to be reflective gentlemen of character who are future-ready.

*   Develop “Every Marist a Leader” through various platforms aimed at developing interpersonal and intrapersonal skills;  
    
*   Develop life-ready competencies and leadership skills such as resilience, communication skills and critical thinking; and
