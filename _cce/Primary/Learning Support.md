The Learning Support Intervention Programme aims to:  

*   Provide learning support to pupils who enter Primary 1 with weak English language and literacy skills; and  
    
*   Provide additional support to pupils who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge to access the Primary 1 Maths curriculum.  
      
    

To achieve these goals, the following programmes are offered:

*   Learning Support Programme (LSP)  
    
*   Learning Support for Maths (LSM)
