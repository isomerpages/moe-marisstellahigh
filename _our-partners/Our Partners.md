<h2>MARIS STELLA HIGH SCHOOL ALUMNI</h2>
<p>The MSHS Alumni is a network of Marist Brothers, educators and students.
This network of Marists aims to foster friendly association among its members,
promote the cultivation of virtue and learning amongst members, seek mutual
welfare for members, and lastly, render assistance in the development of
the alma mater.</p>

<h2>MARIS STELLA HIGH SCHOOL PARENT SUPPORT GROUP</h2>
<p>The Maris Stella High School Parent Support Group (MSHS PSG) consists
of parent volunteers who volunteer time and resources to serve Marists
and the school. In doing so, it serves as a link amongst parents, and between
parents and school. Being a member of the MSHS PSG provides an opportunity
for parents to be involved in their son's growth and development in their
formative secondary school years. We support the school's effort to nurture
aspiring learners and contribute to the dynamic environment of the school.
There are various ways to volunteer your time, effort and resources. We
welcome parents to join us and be part of our boys' school life experience.&nbsp;
