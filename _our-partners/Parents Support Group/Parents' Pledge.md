# Parents' Pledge

As partners in education and role models, we, the parents of Maris Stella High School (Primary), pledge that:

We will support and participate wholeheartedly and selflessly in the activities of the school to achieve holistic development not just for our sons but every boy in the school.

We will work hand in hand with the principal and teachers to guide our sons in their journey towards being gentlemen of faith, vision and service.

  

We will be totally committed to help the school and our sons in their efforts to build a gracious, a socially responsible society and a continually progressing nation.

It is not how much we do, but how much love we put in the doing.

It is not how much we give, but how much love we put in the giving.

\- Mother Teresa
