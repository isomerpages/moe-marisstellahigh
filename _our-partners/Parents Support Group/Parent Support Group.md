### OUR LOGO

The heart represents the loving and secure environment of our boys safeguarded by the school on the one hand (symbolised by the left arc of the heart) and the PSG on the other (symbolised by the right arc of the heart).

The hand below the heart is that of God, carrying and guiding us through this partnership.
