**<font size=5>MESSAGE FROM PSG EXCO</font><a name="MESSAGE FROM PSG EXCO"></a>**



The Maris Stella High School (Primary) Parent Support Group (PSG) has come a long way since its humble beginnings. This handbook aims to provide you with a clearer understanding of the role and mission of the PSG.

The numerous PSG activities conducted for the school would not have been possible if not for the enduring support from the many dedicated parent volunteers.  A very big thank you to all who have given your time and personal contribution.  The school and students have definitely benefited from all our involvement.

The PSG endeavours to continue our partnership with the school to provide a holistic education for our boys.  Together we tap on each other's strengths to make MSHS a more vibrant environment for the boys.  We trust that you will find joining the PSG an enriching and worthwhile experience.

In God We Trust, In Love We Serve<br>

**<font size=5>BRIEF HISTORY</font><a name="BRIEF HISTORY"></a>**

In 1990, a small group of parents from the pre-primary and Primary 1 classes helped to organise a Children’s Fancy Dress Competition. History was made when this first group of parents stepped forward to lend a helping hand to the children and their teachers. These parents continued to help out further in other subsequent school events such as concerts and outings.

Over the years, the Parent Volunteer Programme has evolved in response to changes within the school. The organisation has, together with the students as well as the school administration, grown in a climate of cordiality, cooperation and constructive dialogue.

The number of PSG members has grown over the years and today we have more than 180 members who are actively involved in supporting the school events.

**<font size=5>RELIGIOUS EDUCATION (RE)
</font><a name="RELIGIOUS EDUCATION (RE)"></a>**


As a Catholic School, Maris Stella High School (Primary) offers Religious Education (RE) classes where the boys can learn about the Catholic faith.

  

Parent volunteers conduct weekly RE lessons from 7 am to 7.20 am before school starts. The parents adopt the “Walking with Jesus” syllabus and make it fun by incorporating videos, songs and craft. Many of these parents are catechists in their respective parishes.

  

First Friday masses, and special masses like New Year’s Day mass, Founder’s Day mass, exam masses and Thanksgiving mass are planned throughout the school calendar year. The parents also serve as cantors, musicians, preparation of mass presentations, sacristan duties and helping Marists with the mass readings.

  

The love for sharing of the Catholic faith brought the parents together, and it is indeed the working of the Holy Spirit that seals the bonds among the parents; reaping the reward of witnessing Marists grow spiritually to godly gentlemen after God’s heart.

</font><a name="MORNING DUTY (MD) & RECESS DUTY (RD)"></a>**

PSG members work in collaboration with the teachers to ensure that the students adhere to orderly behaviour in the morning and during the 2 recesses. Duties will be assigned to the PSG members by the PSG coordinator-in-charge.

  

**Morning Duty & Recess Duty PSG Guidelines:**     

<u>Morning Duty</u>  

*   The duration for the morning duty is about 30 min, from 7 a.m. to 7.30 a.m.  
    
*   Ensure all students leave the classroom by 7.15 a.m., bring along a storybook and ask them to proceed to the hall for their morning reading.

*   Ensure that all the students leave the classrooms during recess.  Only the appointed recess ICs and duty boys are allowed to stay in the classrooms.  
    
*   Ensure that the students do not play in the areas other than the designated places. This is to minimise disturbance to other students who are still having lessons.

**<font size=5>RAINBOW READING CLUB (RRC)
</font><a name="RAINBOW READING CLUB (RRC)"></a>**

This programme targets weak readers in P1 and P2 who need support to bridge the gap in their reading proficiency for English and/or Chinese. The program aims to equip them first with beginning literacy and thereafter build reading fluency and vocabulary as well as to inculcate good reading habits and develop their interest in the language.  

  

There are 3 English Rainbow classes each week. The scheduled timings are Tuesdays, Wednesdays andFridays, from 7.00 - 7.30 a.m. for P1 and P2 pupils. Two pupils are assigned to each PSG parent. Parents and the students read story books together (story books are provided by the school). In addition, some oral and comprehension exercises are given to the pupils from time to time. Pupils who make good progress may graduate from the programme.

  

For Chinese Rainbow which is for P2 boys, there will be a story-telling session, which is conducted in groups of 3 to 5, twice a week. The scheduled timings are Mondays and Thursdays from 7.00 - 7.30 a.m. The PSG members read interesting and fun Chinese story books to the boys and encourage them to speak. In addition, PSG parents will conduct games and activities from time to time to motivate them in reading.

  

Parents can help on a day that suits them, in the English and/or Chinese sessions. The teacher-in-charge needs about a month to assess and identify the pupils who need help in reading.  Rainbow normally starts in February and ends in October.

  

PSG parents bond with the boys whom they are helping. As the boys increase fluency in the language through reading, they become more confident and enthusiastic using the language and their self-esteem is enhanced. PSG parents derive immense satisfaction when they see the boys progress as a result of their participation in the programme.
