**<font size=5>MESSAGE FROM PSG EXCO</font><a name="MESSAGE FROM PSG EXCO"></a>**



The Maris Stella High School (Primary) Parent Support Group (PSG) has come a long way since its humble beginnings. This handbook aims to provide you with a clearer understanding of the role and mission of the PSG.

The numerous PSG activities conducted for the school would not have been possible if not for the enduring support from the many dedicated parent volunteers.  A very big thank you to all who have given your time and personal contribution.  The school and students have definitely benefited from all our involvement.

The PSG endeavours to continue our partnership with the school to provide a holistic education for our boys.  Together we tap on each other's strengths to make MSHS a more vibrant environment for the boys.  We trust that you will find joining the PSG an enriching and worthwhile experience.

In God We Trust, In Love We Serve<br>
PSG EXCO
