**<font size=5>MESSAGE FROM PSG EXCO</font><a name="MESSAGE FROM PSG EXCO"></a>**



The Maris Stella High School (Primary) Parent Support Group (PSG) has come a long way since its humble beginnings. This handbook aims to provide you with a clearer understanding of the role and mission of the PSG.

The numerous PSG activities conducted for the school would not have been possible if not for the enduring support from the many dedicated parent volunteers.  A very big thank you to all who have given your time and personal contribution.  The school and students have definitely benefited from all our involvement.

The PSG endeavours to continue our partnership with the school to provide a holistic education for our boys.  Together we tap on each other's strengths to make MSHS a more vibrant environment for the boys.  We trust that you will find joining the PSG an enriching and worthwhile experience.

In God We Trust, In Love We Serve<br>

**<font size=5>BRIEF HISTORY</font><a name="BRIEF HISTORY"></a>**

In 1990, a small group of parents from the pre-primary and Primary 1 classes helped to organise a Children’s Fancy Dress Competition. History was made when this first group of parents stepped forward to lend a helping hand to the children and their teachers. These parents continued to help out further in other subsequent school events such as concerts and outings.

Over the years, the Parent Volunteer Programme has evolved in response to changes within the school. The organisation has, together with the students as well as the school administration, grown in a climate of cordiality, cooperation and constructive dialogue.

The number of PSG members has grown over the years and today we have more than 180 members who are actively involved in supporting the school events.
