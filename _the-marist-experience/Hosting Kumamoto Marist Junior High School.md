<p>On 3 March 2025, we had the pleasure of hosting 40 students and 3 staff
members from Kumamoto Marist Junior High School. Our visitors toured our
school, guided by our Marist Ambassadors who also shared insights on our
school and Singapore. The day was further enriched by a cultural exchange
as our Secondary Three drummers introduced our Japanese visitors to Chinese
Festive Drumming while the latter showcased their karate skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
