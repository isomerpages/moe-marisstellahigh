<p>From 7 to 11 March 2025, our principal, Mr Boy Eng Seng, participated
in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Champagnat Global Meeting at the Hermitage. It was
a congregation of almost 140 Marist educators from all over the world during
which there was sharing on the happenings in the Marist education communities
in various parts of the world as well as collaboration on the Marist response
to the evolving educational landscape of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. (For
