<p>In 2025, the school embarked on the important task of designing its campus.
As the saying goes, we shape the school campus for a few years, and the
campus shapes us for the next few decades. This statement summarises the
importance of school design. Besides the new campus, we are also renovating
the secondary and primary holding sites at Jalan Damai and Mattar Road
respectively. Upon completion in 2027, they will be even better than our
current heritage site.</p>
<p>It's clear that 2025 has been an exceptional year for both students and
educators at Maris Stella. Marists performed very well in both CCA and
national examinations in 2025. Some outstanding achievements include our
Softball 'B' Division Boys making it to national top 4, Chinese Orchestra
and Symphonic Band achieving the Certificate of Distinction for SYF, National
Police Cadet Corps achieving Distinction for Unit Overall Proficiency Award
and our Marist debaters achieving 1st in the National Schools Debate Challenge.
Marist Educators performed very well too. Mr Sui Lei achieved the National
Distinguished Chinese Language Teacher Award, Ms Chloe Toh achieved the
Listening Educator for Advancement and Progress Award and Mr Nicholas Ong
achieved the Outstanding Teacher-Coach Award. These awards span different
aspects of education — language instruction, student support, and coaching
— showing the well-rounded excellence of our teaching staff. In Maris Stella,
we have many passionate and dedicated educators who are willing and able
to bring out the best in our students.</p>
<p>2026 is an important year for us. We will welcome the last batch of Secondary
1 Marists who have the privilege of learning at our heritage site—the birthplace
of Maris Stella. We will also be registering our first batch of co-educational
Primary 1 Marists. For the first time, we will embark on an overseas trip
to Lyon, France, to understand Saint Marcellin Champagnat and the early
Marist Brothers, and to discover how our school connects to the 600+ Marist
schools around the world. In this final year at the heritage site, we welcome
graduated Marists to return to the school to visit their teachers or to
reminisce about the past. Two events to look out for are Homecoming Day
on 11 April and the Mid-Autumn Festival celebration on 18 September.</p>
<p>As a Marist, I am proud to lead my alma mater on this exciting journey
of growth. I am also honoured to work with my team of dedicated and excellent
Marist Educators, not forgetting our Parents Support Group, School Management
Committee and Alumni Association. Together, we will write the new chapter
for Maris Stella.</p>

<h2>校长寄语</h2>
<p>在2025年，学校开启了一项重要的使命——设计我们全新的校园。俗话说：“我们塑造校园数年，校园塑造我们数十载。”这句话精炼地道出了校园设计的深远意义。除了新校舍的建设，我们也同步展开位于惹兰达迈(Jalan
Damai Road)及玛达路(Mattar Road)的中小学临时校舍翻新工程。待2027年完工后，这些校舍将比现有的历史校址更臻完善，焕发新貌。</p>
<p>2025年对海星师生而言，确实是非凡的一年。学生在课外活动与全国考试中皆表现优异。杰出成就包括中学部垒球B组男生勇夺全国前四名，华乐团与交响管乐团双双荣获全国青年艺术节卓越奖章，全国学生警察团荣获全国单位综合表现卓越奖，而辩论队更在全国校际辩论赛中勇夺冠军。教师团队同样成绩斐然：隋磊老师荣获“全国杰出华文教师奖”，卓文爱老师获颁“飞跃教师奖”，王伟杰老师荣获“杰出教练教师奖”。这些奖项涵盖语言教学、关爱学生及体育指导等多元领域，充分展现了海星教师团队的全面卓越与专业精神。海星拥有一群充满热忱、敬业奉献的教育者，他们以不懈的奉献，引领学生追求卓越，迈向高峰。</p>
<p>2026年，对我们而言意义重大。我们将迎来最后一届在原址上学习的中一海星学子——他们有幸在海星的发源地学习成长。同时，海星中学（附小）也将为明年起招收女生，成为混合学校做好准备。这一年，我们更将首次远赴法国里昂，探索圣玛瑟林‧尚帕纳神父与早期的玛利斯修会会士的足迹，了解海星精神的根源，并探索我们与全球600多所玛利斯学校之间的联系。值此原址的最后一年，我们诚挚邀请历届校友重返校园，探望恩师，重温昔日的美好时光。其中两个重点活动包括4月11日的“相聚海星”以及9月18日的“中秋节庆祝会”。</p>
<p>身为一名海星人，我深感荣幸能带领母校迈向新里程，也感恩能与一支敬业卓越的教师团队携手并肩。同时，我也衷心感谢家长会、学校管理委员会与校友会的鼎力支持。我们将继续同心协力，共同谱写海星的新篇章。</p>
