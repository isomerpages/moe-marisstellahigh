<p><strong>The Humanities</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Department</strong>&nbsp;<strong>aims to:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inculcate in Marists a love for the Humanities subjects; and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop Marists to be critical and independent thinkers prepared to face

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To achieve the Department's goals, the following programmes are offered:</strong>
</p>
<ul>

<p>We adopt an Inquiry-Based Learning Approach in our teaching of the Humanities.
It consists of four main areas of inquiry:</p>

</div>
<p>In the study of Humanities, our students are actively engaged in inquiry.
This is best seen in a component called Geographical &amp; Historical Investigations
(GI and HI respectively).</p>
<p>In addition, we work with the Student Development Committee to come up
with a series of Learning Journeys that have their anchor in Humanities
topics and concepts. Some of the Learning Journeys we have completed include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>NEWater Learning Journey</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Madame Tussauds Museum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resilience Trails</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parliament House Visits</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Marists are given the opportunities to participate in the following competitions:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>

<p>Geographical Investigation (GI) and Historical Investigation (HI) are
two forms of inquiry where students investigate a geographical and historical
issue. GI and HI provides students with opportunities to appreciate the
real-world application of geographical and historical knowledge and skills,
as well as help them to acquire the 21st Century Competencies.</p>

<p>Issue Investigation (II) provides a platform for students to demonstrate
the knowledge, skills and values needed for active citizenship. The skill
sets developed through II is closely related to the skill sets developed
through GI and HI at lower secondary. This will also help students to see
the relationship between the different Humanities subjects and appreciate
the skill sets developed through the disciplines which would contribute
towards their development as informed, concerned and participative citizens.</p>

<p>This programme aims to strengthen social cohesion among the different
races in Singapore and to equip students with a foundational grasp in the
respective languages which enables them to engage their counterparts in
the region. It will also help students to enhance rapport with their friends
of different races in the community.
<br>
<br>CMP is conducted fortnightly during curriculum hours for all students
in Chung Cheng. Students will also be exposed to the culture of the Malays
throughout their CMP curriculum in order to enrich their learning of the
language.</p>
