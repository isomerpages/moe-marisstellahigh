<p>Our Humanities Department offers a diverse curriculum encompassing history,
geography, and social studies, aimed at fostering critical thinking and
a deep understanding of human cultures and the environment. Teaching approaches
are varied and innovative, including project-based learning, debates, and
the use of digital technologies, which encourage active participation and
engagement. The department makes learning engaging by incorporating field
trips, guest lectures, and multimedia resources, thus connecting classroom
learning to real-world issues. These methods not only enhance students'
knowledge and skills but also ignite a passion for lifelong learning in
the field of humanities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We adopt an Inquiry-Based Learning Approach in our teaching of the Humanities.
It consists of four main areas of inquiry:</p>

<p>In the study of Humanities, our students are actively engaged in inquiry.
This is best seen in a component called Geographical &amp; Historical Investigations
(GI and HI respectively) and learning journeys.</p>

<p>Geographical Investigation (GI) and Historical Investigation (HI) are
two forms of inquiry where students investigate a geographical and historical
issue. GI and HI provides students with opportunities to appreciate the
real-world application of geographical and historical knowledge and skills,
as well as help them to acquire the 21st Century Competencies.</p>

<p>Issue Investigation (II) provides a platform for students to demonstrate
the knowledge, skills and values needed for active citizenship. The skill
sets developed through II is closely related to the skill sets developed
through GI and HI at lower secondary. This will also help students to see
the relationship between the different Humanities subjects and appreciate
the skill sets developed through the disciplines which would contribute
towards their development as informed, concerned and participative citizens.</p>
