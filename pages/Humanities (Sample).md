<p>Our Humanities Department offers a diverse curriculum encompassing history,
geography, and social studies, aimed at fostering critical thinking and
a deep understanding of human cultures and the environment. Teaching approaches
are varied and innovative, including project-based learning, debates, and
the use of digital technologies, which encourage active participation and
engagement. The department makes learning engaging by incorporating field
trips, guest lectures, and multimedia resources, thus connecting classroom
learning to real-world issues. These methods not only enhance students'
knowledge and skills but also ignite a passion for lifelong learning in
the field of humanities.</p>
