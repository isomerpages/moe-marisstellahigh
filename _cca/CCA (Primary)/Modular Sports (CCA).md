**The Modular CCA (Sports) aims to:** 

*   Create an additional platform for Marists who are keen in learning a new sport apart from the current sports and games CCAs offered in school; and
*   Expose Marists to at least 2 different kinds of sports within the academic year in the  hope to heighten awareness and continue to have an interest in the sport.

**To achieve the CCA’s goals, the following programmes are offered:** 

*   Aikido Programme
*   Kin-Ball introductory Programme (Tentative)
