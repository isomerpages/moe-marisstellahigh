**The St John Brigade aims to:** 

*   Groom our cadets to be Marist Gentlemen of Faith, Vision and Service by engaging them in purposeful and engaging activities;   
    
*   Develop a spirit of camaraderie amongst the cadets and officers with the support of our Alumni who serve as trainers and mentors to our cadets; and  
    
*   Provide a holistic 4-year CCA journey with the incorporation of enrichment activities such as air rifle, archery, kayaking, Total Defence lessons and heritage trails.   
    

  

**To achieve the CCA’s goals, the following programmes are offered:** 

*   March Orientation Camp   
    
*   Sec 3 Advanced Non-Commissioned Officers (NCO) Camp  
    
*   First-Aid Certification (BCLS, ACLS, CPR-AED)  
    
*   Public duties such as Walkathons and events where our cadets act as first-line first-aiders
