**The Archery Club aims to:** 

*   Build archers’ physical strength and mental discipline. Each well-executed shot is an encapsulation of concentration, dexterity and grace;
*   Refine and develop the archers’ skills continually to ensure that they are equipped to participate in competitions at various levels in both individual and team events; 
*   Groom archers to exemplify qualities of true Sportsmen and be ever mindful of the importance of fairness, respect, and a sense of fellowship with one's competitors; and 
*   Develop desirable character traits such as determination and diligence, and build a resilient and united team.   
    

**To achieve the CCA’s goals, the following programmes are offered:**  

*   Physical Fitness Training – to have a set of physical exercises tailored for archers, for example, exercises that strengthen upper body muscles, improve stamina, flexibility, hand-leg coordination etc.   
    
*   Shooting Technique Training - to establish a keen sensitivity for fine motor action in every shot  
    
*   Character and Team Building Activities  
    
*   Opportunities for all archers to participate in various locally organised competitions
