**<u>Handphone Policy</u>**  

All Marists are strongly encouraged to use the public phones available at the school porch, or in case of emergency, the general office phone to contact their family members. The school understands that parents give their sons the handphone for ease of communication and would allow handphones to be brought into the school under these conditions: 

  

1.  Only P3 to P6 Marists are allowed to bring handphones to school.  
      
    
2.  Handphones may be brought to school for the sole purpose of making emergency calls or texting messages to parents or guardians. They are NOT to be used for recreational and/or recording purposes at any time.  
      
    
3.  Handphones must be switched OFF before students enter the school premise in the morning.  
      
    
4.  Handphones must be locked in the students’ locker the moment they reach the classroom and throughout the day until dismissal (refer to points number 5 and 6) to deter any possibility of theft.  
      
    
5.  Handphones must not be visible under any circumstances when in school and/or in the school bus, even though they are switched OFF, unless permission is given by the teacher or school authority.  
      
    
6.  Handphones can be switched on and used strictly to communicate with parents after school dismissal outside school premise and/ or ONLY at the following timing and venue in the school premise:  
    

*   On Mondays and Tuesdays: after Supplementary/ Remedial lessons (if any)  
    
*   On Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays: after CCAs (if any)  
    
*   Venue: Waiting area outside General Office or at the MRT gate.

  

7\. On CCA days, the students are required to surrender their handphones to the teachers on duty.  
  
8\. For Learning Journeys during curriculum time and/or extra lessons or CCAs during the holidays, handphones must be kept in the locker or with the teachers on duty until the end of the day unless otherwise stated.

  

9\. If a handphone rings, vibrates, is used for any reason or is visible anytime during school time, recess time, lunch time or if a student is caught using it during class or CCA time while walking around the school, the student will be asked to surrender the handphone to the General Office. The student will be given a Reflection Form to be acknowledged by his parent(s).

  

10\. Refusal to surrender your handphone when asked is considered as defiance. Consequences will be meted out for acts of defiance (e.g. CWO) and parent(s) will be contacted.

  
11\. All handphones are to be labelled and secured with a password lock. Students are responsible for taking care of their personal belongings and bring the handphones to school at their own risk.  
  

12\. The school will not bear any responsible for any theft/ loss/ damage of the students’ handphone.  
  

13\. Parents/ Guardians may contact their child/ ward via their handphone after school dismissal, CCA, Remedial or Supplementary lessons. In the event of an immediate emergency, please call the main school line at 6282 7743.  
  

The staff of Maris Stella High School seeks the full cooperation of parents and guardians with our policy so that the school environment is conducive for meaningful interaction and learning for all Marists.
