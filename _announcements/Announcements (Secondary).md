**RELEASE OF 2022 SINGAPORE-CAMBRIDGE GCE O-LEVEL EXAMINATION RESULTS**

Dear Class of 2022 Marists,

As shared in the MOE Press Release, the results of the 2022 GCE O-Level examination will be released on Thursday, 12 January 2023, 2pm. **Please report to Shaw Hall in school uniform at 1.45pm** for the briefing and collection of the exam certificates and results. Your parents may accompany you to the school to collect the results on that day.  

If you are unwell or self-isolating due to being tested positive for COVID-19, you should not return to school to collect your results. You can access your results online via SEAB’s Candidates Portal ([https://myexams.seab.gov.sg](https://myexams.seab.gov.sg/)) on the result release day. The system will be available for the students to access their results from 2.45pm on Thursday, 12 January 2023 to 11.59pm on Thursday, 26 January 2023.  

Students who are eligible for Singpass can use their Singpass account to access SEAB’s Candidates Portal. School candidates who are International Students will receive their system-generated username via email from Monday, 9 January 2023. The guide to access the SEAB result release system is attached below for your reference.  

If you are unable to collect your results in person, you can also appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of your results on your behalf from the school. Proxies are required to complete the proxy form (see attached) and produce the relevant documents for the school’s verification when collecting the results. You may contact us for assistance if you are unable to appoint a proxy, or if you have not received your system-generated username for SEAB’s Candidates Portal.  

Please feel free to contact your form teachers or our ECG Counsellor, Mr Benjamin Png at email: benjamin\_png\_heng\_ju@schools.gov.sg, for guidance on your education pathways. You may also refer to the following websites to find out more about the range of education and career pathways available:
