<p>For parents who are accompanying their child/ ward, do note that there

<p>Students who are unwell are advised to seek medical attention and avoid
returning to school to collect their results. Students who are unable to
collect their results in person can appoint a proxy to collect a physical
copy of their results on their behalf from the school. Proxies are required
to produce the relevant documents for the school’s verification when collecting
the results. A copy of the proxy form can be found at this link</p>
