## Announcements (Secondary)

#### Release of GCE O Level Results 2024

The results of the 2024 GCE O-Level examination will be released on Friday, 10 January 2025. All students are to report to the Shaw Hall by 1.50pm on Friday. Students should be appropriately attired and groomed. The session will begin at 2.00pm.

For parents who are accompanying their child/ ward, do note that there is no parking within the school compound. Parents should instead park their vehicles at multi-storey carparks in the HDB blocks nearby.

Students who are unwell are advised to seek medical attention and avoid returning to school to collect their results. Students who are unable to collect their results in person can appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results on their behalf from the school. Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents for the school’s verification when collecting the results. A copy of the proxy form can be found at this link [https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/post-secondary/2025-jae/jae-proxy-form.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/post-secondary/2025-jae/jae-proxy-form.pdf).
