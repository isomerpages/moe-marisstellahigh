**CATHOLIC EDUCATION SUNDAY MASS 13 SEPT 2020**

As a Catholic school, we have been celebrating Catholic Education Sunday since 2017.&nbsp; In the past three years, Catholic schools celebrated with different parishes across Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;  

  

Staff and students from our school joined the community at the Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, serving as lectors, singing in the choirs and assisting in various ways.&nbsp; Parish priests have been very&nbsp;supportive and increasingly, parishes embrace our Catholic Schools as part of the larger Catholic Community in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This year, owing to the Covid-19 safety measures that have been put in place, we will celebrate Catholic Education Sunday differently. All Catholic schools in Singapore will come together to celebrate Catholic Education Sunday with an online Mass.

Besides the Mass celebrated by Fr Adrian Danker, SJ and Principal of SJI, other highlights in the celebration included the mass readings led by students, Prayer of the Faithful led by parent, teacher and religious representatives, student virtual choirs comprising pre-schools, primary and secondary schools and Catholic Junior College, a prayer of Blessings by our Archbishop and a virtual choir comprising principals, teachers and our religious community of priests, nuns and brothers.

Join us for this celebration! All are welcome!

  

Date: 13 September 2020&nbsp;<br>
Time: From 8 am onwards&nbsp;<br>
