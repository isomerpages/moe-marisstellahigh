### 永恒的海星精神  

### THE MARIS STELLA SPIRIT PREVAILS 
	


海星中学创办于1958年，从当初“一所没有校园的学校”发展为今天这样一所规模庞大、设施完善的现代化学府，海星一直带着创办人孙光汉修士的信念与梦想与时并进着。

  

在1976年小学部扩建之后，海星的办学能力更上一层楼。1979年，由于在培养双语双文化人才方面的杰出表现，海星中学被教育部遴选为第一批特选中学之一。注重孩子的全面发展，让他们成为精通双语、具有深厚的文化理解力与适应力的21世纪人才是海星教育引以为豪的传统与特质。

  

From its founding in 1958, where it was “a school without a home”, Maris Stella High School has flourished into a large, modern school constantly improving and renewing itself while keeping faith with the dream of its founder, Brother Joche Chanel Soon.

The current school site expanded to cater to the learning needs of more students through the building of the Primary Section in 1976. As one of the pioneer SAP schools since 1979, Maris Stella High School prides itself on providing a holistic and interesting programme for students to be culturally sensitive and effectively bilingual. The hallmark of the Marist education is the dedication to holistic development and excellence as well as the effective enculturation of bilingual students who are ready for the 21st century.

### 第一个十年（1958年至1968年）

1958年，由于圣母昆仲会掌管的公教中学学额供不应求，因此孙光汉修士创办了新加坡海星中学。

创校初期，我校开设了4个小一班（共163名学生）和4个中一班（124名学生）。教员人数，包括校长孙光汉修士在内，共有11人。我们借用实迄纳路的圣史蒂芬小学校舍在下午上课。

不久，随着学生人数增加，圣史蒂芬小学校舍的课室已无法满足需求。从1963年1月2日至1966年10月22日，我校向多所学校求助，期间同时使用分布在不同地方、彼此间距离甚远的各所学校上课。这是海星中学最艰难的时期，我校在 行政和教学上面对诸多挑战。

然而，凭着孙汉光修士坚强的意志以及老师们的敬业奉献精神，大家不畏艰难、群策群力，使这段艰苦的岁月成为我校弥足珍贵的回忆。在如此艰难的条件下，学生们却年年在政府考试中获得百分之百的及格率，书写着我校的历史。

1966年，海星中学掀开了历史新篇章。经历了9年的"流浪生涯"，我校终于喜迁位于翡珑山的新校舍。这座属于我们自己的校舍拥有15间课室和4层的科教楼。我校在1967年举行了盛大隆重的新校舍开幕仪式，全校师生无不为之雀跃万分。迁入新校舍之后，我校迅速发展，1968年完成第二阶段的建设，国专堂、食堂、图书馆和行政办公室均于此阶段竣工。

Brother Chanel founded Maris Stella High School in 1958 in response to the need for another school because of overwhelming applications for admission to Catholic High School that was run by the Marist Brothers.

The school started with four Primary One classes (163 pupils) and four Secondary One classes (124 pupils) and a staff of eleven including the Principal, Brother Chanel. Classes functioned in the afternoon at St. Stephen’s Primary School in Siglap.

Soon the school expanded and more classrooms were needed. As St. Stephen's Primary School could no longer accommodate the growing student population, other schools were approached for assistance and subsequently, Maris Stella functioned concurrently at different premises. Among them were Silat Road Government Integrated Primary School, St. Patrick’s School, Opera Estate Convent, Tung Ling English School, Jalan Kembangan Integrated Primary School. The school occupied these premises at various times from 2nd January 1963 to 22nd October 1966, which resulted in numerous problems in administration and in conducting lessons.

In the pursuit of having our own school premises, Brother Chanel worked tirelessly to raise funds from various people such as the businessmen from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry. His dogged determination to raise sufficient funds and the staff’s dedication and loyalty to educating Marists made those difficult years memorable ones. It brought out the best in the staff who together with the Principal, overcame many problems. Needless to say, the students contributed no less to the success story of the school with their consistent 100% passes in the Government Examinations.

A new phase in the history of Maris Stella High School began in 1966 when we moved to our own school compound at Mount Vernon Road. A grand celebration was held in 1967 to mark the official opening of the new school, which had fifteen classrooms and a four-storey science block. Development now came swiftly. 1968 saw the completion of the second phase, an adjoining block consisting of the Lee Kuo Chuan Hall, a canteen, a library and administration offices.

### 第二个十年（1969年至1978年)

在此期间我校得到了持续而稳步的发展。第二阶段的建设竣工以后，孙光汉修士决定展开第三阶段的建设工程，即楼高5层的小学部教学楼。但是，直至1974年底，这项工程才最终获得批准。建设进展顺利，于1975年10月竣工。这栋新教学楼耗资110万元，于1976年9月11日正式启用。

The second decade saw the gradual but steady development of Maris Stella High School. With the completion of the second phase of development, Brother Chanel decided to proceed with the next project – a 5-storey building for the primary section. This marked the third phase of Brother Chanel’s development plan for the school. However, it was not until the end of 1974 that permission was granted by the government to launch this project. Construction began soon after and the building was completed by the end of October 1975. It was built at a cost of about $1.1 million. This new building was officially declared open on 11 September 1976.

### 第三个十年（1979年至1988年)

第三个十年的发展是海星中学发展史上重要的里程碑。首先，在1979年，我校被遴选为特选中学，这不仅仅是对我校过去二十年办学成就的认可，更给海星中学带来了更多的资金与资源，促进了海星的进一步发展。此外，由于小学部的学额供不应求，我校必须为小学部另外营建校舍。经过多次协商，在著名实业家陈共存先生的协助下，政府终于在1982年为小学部划出一块毗邻中学部、面积3.11公顷的土地，营建小学校舍。为了减低营建成本，校舍从原定的四层楼高减为三层楼高。政府批准了此项计划并慷慨资助。随着校舍的营建成本不断高涨，陆淳智修士（1983年至1984年掌校）和陈金福修士（1984年至2009年掌校）开始着手带领学校积极筹措资金。孙光汉修士，虽然在1981年因健康欠佳退休，但仍旧积极参与募款活动。

A very significant milestone in the school’s history was the fourth phase of development with the building of a separate building for the primary section due to the overwhelming demand from parents and students. After some initial difficulties in selecting a suitable site for the school, it was finally decided that the primary section be situated on the piece of land adjacent to the secondary section in 1982. This was also made possible due to the help provided by the philanthropist, Mr Tan Keong Choon.

The original plan for a four-storey building was changed to a three-storey one in order to cut costs. With the approval of our new plan and a generous grant from the Government, we set out to raise more funds to meet the escalating building cost. At the helm of this massive fund-raising project were Brother John Lek, Brother Anthony Tan, and Brother Chanel who although having retired in 1981 due to poor health, continued to be actively involved in raising funds for the school.

### 第四个十年（1989年至1998年)

小学部于1987年建竣完工，校园就一直沿用至今。1996年，我校成为自治学校，得到政府的额外拨款支持，可以为海星学子提供更多样化的学习项目并建设更完善的设施。1997年开始，小学实行单班制。我们也对学校设施进行了小规模的改进：将图书馆建成了多媒体资讯图书馆；将行政办公室和教员室进行小规模翻修，完善办公设备，增设了两间电脑室；此外，所有的课室也都备有资讯科技配备，校园范围内均有互联网络覆盖。

The primary section has been functioning at its present premises since 1987. In 1996, our school became an Autonomous School with additional funds to provide extra programmes and facilities for Marists. Since 1997, the primary section has been functioning as a single-session school. Minor improvements were made to the building with the conversion of the library to a media resource library, an improved administration office and staff room with system furniture and the inclusion of two computer laboratories. All classrooms are now IT-enabled and the school is fully networked.

### 第五个十年（1999年至2008年)

我校于2002年获选为北区第四校群资讯与通讯科技卓越中心。此外，我校荣获新加坡优异奖、新加坡素质教育奖、最佳治校奖以及持续成就奖。

In 2002, the school was designated the N4 Centre of Excellence for Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Other noteworthy awards include the School Distinction Award, Singapore Quality Class, Best Practice Award for Teaching and Learning, and Sustained Achievement Awards.

### 第六个十年（2009年至今）

2009年林俊杰先生从陈金福修士手中接过校长的接力棒，掌校至2015年。林校长继续发扬我校优良的办学传统与校园文化。在他的领导下，学校致力于提高教师的教学能力，以趣味激发学生的学习热情，做到“教”与“学”齐头并进。学校也因此在2014年荣获教育部颁发的四项最佳治校奖，分别是教学、员工福利、学生全面发展以及品德教育。

从2016年起，辜素敏女士担任我校校长。为了帮助海星学子能应对世界未来科技与经济发展的挑战，辜素敏女士带领全校老师为学校树立了全新的愿景：凡我海星学子，当为恪守信念、富有远见、服务人群的谦谦君子。希望海星中学在此愿景的感召与指引下，每一位学生与老师们能上下一心，以身作则，让海星的育人大业更上一层楼。

2018年，海星已走过一甲子的春华秋实。为了纪念这个重要的里程碑，我们以“甲子情，海星梦”为主题，举行了一系列的庆祝活动。回忆过去60年所走过的足迹，海星在育人上培养了许多对社会各个领域有所贡献的人，这要归功于学校所强调的道德教育、海星价值观，以及学校的校训：勤勉忠勇。即使毕业多年后，海星学子依然秉持着海星校训和海星价值观的精神身体力行。除此之外，在这喜庆之际，我们也要感谢上帝对海星中学的眷顾与祝福。60载物换星移，成千上万的莘莘学子在海星校园中留下了无数美好的青春记忆，这些美好的回忆把一代代海星学子凝聚在一起，凝成了超越时空的兄弟情谊。他们趁此创校庆典，相约回到母校团聚，回忆在校求学时的点点滴滴，并向他们劳苦功高的老师致敬。回顾过去，展望未来，让我们珍惜海星学子这60年对学校的深厚情感，继续谱写海星育人的动人故事。但愿海星中学在学校的新愿景“凡我海星学子，当为恪守信念、富有远见、服务人群的谦谦君子。”的指引下，继续追逐另一个60年的海星梦。

The school leadership baton was passed from Brother Anthony Tan to Mr Joseph Lim who was the Principal from 2009 to 2015. His leadership continued the spirit of excellence in our school culture and ethos. Staff competency was developed to create the joy of learning among students. Teaching and learning continued to be our pride and glory as the school received Best Practice in Teaching and Learning, Character and Citizenship Education, Staff Well-being and Development, and Student All-Round Development in 2014.

As the Principal from 2016 onwards, Mrs Woo Soo Min galvanised the school to carry out a staff envisioning exercise to bring the school closer to our mission of inculcating young men with values and faith. Through the year-long envisioning exercise, Marist educators, in consultation with the Marist Brothers, Alumni and School Management Committee, crafted the new school vision: Every Marist, a Gentleman of Faith, Vision and Service. With this vision in mind, we hope to offer a coherent and holistic 10-year Marist Education to all Marists anchored in the Catholic faith, biculturalism and school tradition.  

In 2018, Maris Stella High School celebrated the 60th anniversary of its founding. The theme for the celebration was Rejoice . Reunion . Rejuvenate. Over the past 60 years, the school has done very well in nurturing Marists to their potential and won many accolades. The success of Marists whilst in school and the contributions of Marists in society after they have graduated bears testimony to strong inculcation of Marist values and school motto in our students. We rejoice and give thanks to God for His many blessings on the school and Marists. The past 60 years witnessed the forging of strong bonds of brotherhood amongst Marists amidst an environment where family spirit immensely fills the school atmosphere. Marists from the various generations returned to their Alma Mater to reunite with their brothers and pay tribute to their teachers for moulding them to become who they are today. As we look forward to the next 60 years of school development, we are inspired by the many stories told by Marists of how their teachers have made a difference in their lives and we seek to rejuvenate the school to nurture every Marist to become a gentleman of faith, vision and service.
