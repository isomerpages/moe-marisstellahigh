2023 was an amazing year. The school received many encouraging results. Whether it was the results of the School Staff Engagement Survey, the Quality of the School Experience results, or the results of the PSLE and O Level examinations, we did very well in all of them. My sincere thanks to all of the staff members who had put tremendous effort into achieving such outstanding results.
 
For the school to reach the next level of excellence, we need to focus on three areas: school **pride**, school **relationships**, and the **10-year Marist education**, which we like to call PR10.
 
There are many things about the school that staff as well as students can be proud of. We have a rich history as a school, and every year we produce excellent results, demonstrating our commitment to excellence. The school will foster greater pride by nurturing stronger student leaders, improving the working and learning environment and providing students with increased opportunities to showcase their talents and contribute to make the school a better place. In addition, the school will be progressing from Boy-Centric Education to **Gentleman-Focused Education** in 2024 so as to align more closely with the school vision. 
 
There is no doubt that relationships are key to a school's success. For students to learn well, there must be good rapport between teachers and students. When students have strong friendships, they will enjoy school more. Staff members will also achieve their best outcomes at work if there is a collegial atmosphere among colleagues. The school will make an effort to foster strong relationships at all levels, along with strengthening partnerships between the school and parents.
 
We believe that being a Special Assistance Plan full-school gives us a strategic advantage. The school will leverage on the synergy between the primary and secondary sections to build a strong school identity as well as to develop more bilingual and bicultural talents through its Brother Chanel Bicultural Programme.
 
There was no doubt that the school had performed well in 2023 and I believe this is just the beginning of the next upward curve. With the support of the School Management Committee and the Alumni Association, I am confident that we will be able to take the school to the next level of excellence in the next few years.

## 校长寄语

  

2023年，我们交出了一份漂亮的成绩单。无论是教职员满意度问卷（School Staff Engagement Survey）、学校体验质量调查（Quality of School Experience），还是小六离校考试和中四会考，我们都有杰出的表现。我由衷感谢为此尽心尽力的教职员。
 
在继续求追卓越的道路上，我们需要关注三个方面：学校自豪感、学校关系和十年海星教育计划，我们称之为 PR10。
 
教职员工和学生都应该为学校感到自豪。作为一所学校，我们有着悠久的历史。每年我们都取得优异的成绩，展示了我们对追求卓越的精神。为培养师生的自豪感，学校将通过培养更优秀的学生领袖、改善工作和学习环境、为学生提供更多展示才华机会，让他们为学校做出贡献。此外，学校将在 2024 年把以男生为中心的教育改为以君子为本的教育。这改变也更符合我校的愿景。 
 
毫无疑问，人际关系是成功的关键。为了让学生学得好，老师和学生之间必须有良好的师生关系。当学生拥有坚固的友谊，他们将更享受在校的学习时光。如果同事之间的合作氛围融洽，老师们也会在工作中取得最好的成果。学校将努力在各个层面建立稳固的关系，同时加强学校与家长之间的伙伴关系。 
 
作为一所特别辅助计划学校，我们有资源方面的优势。我们的小学部和中学部将一同合作，加强学生对学校认同感。我们也将通过孙光汉修士双文化特选课程培养更多双语和双文化人才。 
 
我相信我校在2023年的杰出表现，只是我们攀越另一个高峰的开始。在学校管理层和校友会的支持下，我有信心在未来几年内，我校必能更上一层楼。
