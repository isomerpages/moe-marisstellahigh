<p><strong>MESSAGE FROM PSG EXCO</strong>
</p>
<p>The Maris Stella High School (Primary) Parent Support Group (PSG) has
come a long way since its humble beginnings. This handbook aims to provide
you with a clearer understanding of the role and mission of the PSG.</p>
<p>The numerous PSG activities conducted for the school would not have been
possible if not for the enduring support from the many dedicated parent
volunteers. &nbsp;A very big thank you to all who have given your time
and personal contribution. &nbsp;The school and students have definitely
benefited from all our involvement.</p>
<p>The PSG endeavours to continue our partnership with the school to provide
a holistic education for our boys. &nbsp;Together we tap on each other’s
strengths to make MSHS a more vibrant environment for the boys. &nbsp;We
trust that you will find joining the PSG an enriching and worthwhile experience.</p>
<p>In God We Trust, In Love We Serve
<br>PSG EXCO</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>BRIEF HISTORY</strong>
</p>
<p>In 1990, a small group of parents from the pre-primary and Primary 1 classes
helped to organise a Children’s Fancy Dress Competition. History was made
when this first group of parents stepped forward to lend a helping hand
to the children and their teachers. These parents continued to help out
further in other subsequent school events such as concerts and outings.</p>
<p>Over the years, the Parent Volunteer Programme has evolved in response
to changes within the school. The organisation has, together with the students
as well as the school administration, grown in a climate of cordiality,
cooperation and constructive dialogue.</p>
<p>The number of PSG members has grown over the years and today we have more
than 180 members who are actively involved in supporting the school events.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PSG PHILOSOPHY</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe that educating children is a joint effort between the school
and the home.&nbsp;Parents play a vital role in impacting values.</p>
<p>The school-PSG partnership aims to achieve one common goal – that of providing
a rich and rewarding holistic education for our students guided by the
Marist values.</p>
<p><strong>Expectations of PSG Members:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Uphold the School motto and philosophy of the PSG.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>RELIGIOUS EDUCATION (RE)</strong>
</p>
<p>As a Catholic School, Maris Stella High School (Primary) offers Religious
Education (RE) classes where the boys can learn about the Catholic faith.</p>
<p>Parent volunteers conduct weekly RE lessons from 7 am to 7.20 am before
school starts. The parents adopt the “Walking with Jesus” syllabus and
make it fun by incorporating videos, songs and craft. Many of these parents
are catechists in their respective parishes.</p>
<p>First Friday masses, and special masses like New Year’s Day mass, Founder’s
Day mass, exam masses and Thanksgiving mass are planned throughout the
school calendar year. The parents also serve as cantors, musicians, preparation
of mass presentations, sacristan duties and helping Marists with the mass
readings.</p>
<p>The love for sharing of the Catholic faith brought the parents together,
and it is indeed the working of the Holy Spirit that seals the bonds among
the parents; reaping the reward of witnessing Marists grow spiritually
to godly gentlemen after God’s heart.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>MARIST BOOK LAB (MBL)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Marist Book Lab in MSHS (Primary) is a modern, air-conditioned facility

<p><strong>RAINBOW READING CLUB (RRC)</strong>
</p>
<p>This programme targets weak readers in P1 and P2 who need support to bridge
the gap in their reading proficiency for English and/or Chinese. The program
aims to equip them first with beginning literacy and thereafter build reading
fluency and vocabulary as well as to inculcate good reading habits and
develop their interest in the language.</p>
<p>There are 3 English Rainbow classes each week. The scheduled timings are
Tuesdays, Wednesdays andFridays, from 7.00 -&nbsp;7.30 a.m. for P1 and
P2 pupils. Two pupils are assigned to each PSG parent. Parents and the
students read story books together (story books are provided by the school).
In addition, some oral and comprehension exercises are given to the pupils
from time to time. Pupils who make good progress may graduate from the
programme.</p>
<p>For Chinese Rainbow which is for P2 boys, there will be a story-telling
session, which is conducted in groups of 3 to 5, twice a week. The scheduled
timings are Mondays and Thursdays from 7.00 - 7.30 a.m. The PSG members
read interesting and fun Chinese story books to the boys and encourage
them to speak. In addition, PSG parents will conduct games and activities
from time to time to motivate them in reading.</p>
<p>Parents can help on a day that suits them, in the English and/or Chinese
sessions. The teacher-in-charge needs about a month to assess and identify
the pupils who need help in reading. &nbsp;Rainbow normally starts in February
and ends in October.</p>
<p>PSG parents bond with the boys whom they are helping. As the boys increase
fluency in the language through reading, they become more confident and
enthusiastic using the language and their self-esteem is enhanced. PSG
parents derive immense satisfaction when they see the boys progress as
a result of their participation in the programme.</p>
