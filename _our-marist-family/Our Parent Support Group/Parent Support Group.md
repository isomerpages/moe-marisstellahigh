<h2>MARIS STELLA HIGH SCHOOL PARENT SUPPORT GROUP</h2>
<p>The Maris Stella High School Parent Support Group (MSHS PSG) consists
of parent volunteers who volunteer time and resources to serve Marists
and the school. In doing so, it serves as a link amongst parents, and between
parents and school. Being a member of the MSHS PSG provides an opportunity
for parents to be involved in their son’s growth and development in their
formative secondary school years. We support the school’s effort to nurture
aspiring learners and contribute to the dynamic environment of the school.
There are various ways to volunteer your time, effort and resources. We
welcome parents to join us and be part of our boys’ school life experience.&nbsp;</p>
