<h1>Parentsâ€™ Pledge</h1>
<p>As partners in education and role models, we, the parents of Maris Stella
High School (Primary), pledge that:</p>
<p>We will support and participate wholeheartedly and selflessly in the activities
of the school to achieve holistic development not just for our sons but
every boy in the school.</p>
<p>We will work hand in hand with the principal and teachers to guide our
sons in their journey towards being gentlemen of faith, vision and service.</p>
<p>We will be totally committed to help the school and our sons in their
efforts to build a gracious, a socially responsible society and a continually
progressing nation.</p>
<p>It is not how much we do, but how much love we put in the doing.</p>
<p>It is not how much we give, but how much love we put in the giving.</p>
<p>- Mother Teresa</p>
