<br>The school’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme aim to
nurture Marists into Gentlemen of Faith, Vision and Service. Our flagship
programme, The Marcellin Way, is a 10-year programme that serves to provide
a holistic education for the Marists. The Marcellin Way embodies the meaningful
programmes and students outcomes we seek to achieve through the school-wide
CCE. These outcomes are derived from the Marist Values of Presence, Simplicity,
Family Spirit, Love of Work and In the Way of Mary. These values were distilled
in the life and experiences of Saint Marcellin Champagnat, who founded
the Marist Brothers in 1817. As Marists, our young gentlemen are nurtured
to live by the principle of upholding the Marist Values and school motto,&nbsp;
勤&nbsp;&nbsp; 勉&nbsp;&nbsp; 忠&nbsp;&nbsp; 勇.</p>
<p>To achieve these goals, the following programmes are offered:</p>

<p></p>
<p>On 8 November 2017, as part of the Project CARE programme, 34 of us, P6
Marists, visited the Saint Theresa’s Home, a Nursing Home for the elderly,
established in 1935 by the Little Sisters of the Poor.</p>
<p>Before the visit, we had to learn some Cantonese so that we would be able
to converse with the elderly folks at the home. We also had to learn how
to hold a decent conversation with a stranger. We met and discussed as
a team on what activities we could possibly conduct for the elderly. So
how did our visit go?</p>
<p>Our mission that day was to bring joy to the elderly, through love and
service. Firstly, we played Bingo with the elderly. The elderly found it
challenging to spot the numbers because of their failing eyesight and we
had to help them with this. The winners were REALLY happy.</p>
<p>It was very humbling to see such a BRIGHT smile on the crinkly face of
an elderly when they got hold of a packet drink and biscuit. It made me
think how simple their lives were and how complicated I had made my life
to be. Our team of Marists made sure all the elderly were winners eventually!
We really wanted everyone in the room to be happy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We then served the elderly ice-cream, bananas and grapes. Many of the
elderly were delighted with the ice cream. This was no expensive ice cream,
just the usual POTONG stick ice-cream from NTUC. Once again, I was humbled
by how the little things in life could make them so happy.</p>
<p>After eating, we played more games with the elderly. Now, this was challenging.
Despite our efforts, we did struggle in keeping the elderly engaged as
they were very tired and sleepy in the humid afternoon. They could not
completely understand us despite our best efforts to speak Cantonese. We
persevered though, trying our best to make the elderly smile.</p>
<p>At this point in time, my friends who had volunteered to clean the wheelchairs
were back in the activity room. Their PE T-shirts were plastered to their
bodies, and they were drenched in sweat as they had been working really
hard under the hot sun to wash and dry the wheelchairs for the elderly.
I was impressed by their determination. They did not utter a single word
of complaint. Instead, they kept asking me if they could also help out.</p>
<p>I got to push some of the elderly on their wheelchairs, around the home,
for some fresh air. I was surprised that the elderly, though not in the
pink of health, were actively involved in growing the vegetables they consumed
in the Home’s garden. I was inspired by their fierce commitment and independence.</p>
<p>It was indeed an afternoon well spent. I could have just simply stayed
at home and play games on my mobile phone or watch television, but I am
glad I did not.</p>
<p>Many of the elderly are ill and lonely. They needed their wheelchairs
to move about. They did not seem to get many visitors and were visibly
happy to see young people like us visiting them. The visit to the Home
has helped me appreciate what I have. I should not take my health and the
people around me for granted. I am more determined to lead a healthy life
in order to stay healthy and I will appreciate my family. I think we should
never ever put our parents in an elderly home.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate that we could only spend 2 hours at the Home. If it
had been longer, I am sure we would all benefit even more from the collective
wisdom of the elderly. They have a wealth of real-life experiences to share
with us.</p>
<p>I would like to end my sharing by encouraging all of you to participate
actively whenever you are invited by your teachers to volunteer your time
and service to help the less fortunate around us. I am happy that I had
the chance to live out the Marist Creed, by giving love and service to
others. I hope you will get a chance to do so too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexuality Education (SEd)
in schools aims to enable students to understand the physiological, social
and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and
rewarding relationships with others, including those with members of the
opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality
matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit
of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and
stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching
and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the
different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;<strong>Goals</strong>&nbsp;of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp; Support students in managing their physiological, social and
emotional changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions
on sexuality matters.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves
and others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;<strong>Key Messages</strong>&nbsp;of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which
are the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW OF SEXUALITY EDUCATION PROGRAMME FOR 2025 Programme</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>MARIS STELLA HIGH SCHOOL (PRIMARY)</strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education is delivered
in a holistic manner through the school curriculum.&nbsp;The content for
Sexuality Education is grouped into five main themes: Human Development,
Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture,
Society and Law. You may click&nbsp;<a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>&nbsp;for
more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subjects that incorporate
topics on sexuality include:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong>Sexuality Education Lessons</strong>:</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upper primary years mark
the onset of puberty. With better nutrition and improved health care, children
are reaching puberty at a younger age and have to grapple with physical,
emotional and psychological changes in themselves. The implication is that
our children are becoming biologically ready for sexual activity sooner
without necessarily having the corresponding cognitive or emotional maturity
to modulate their behaviours. Furthermore, our young are also exposed to
a wide range of influences that could endanger health and undermine the
integrity of the family. Our students require guidance so that they can
respond with discernment to the sexual messages in the media and other
sources.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd)
lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP) at Primary 5 and 6. Through these
lessons, students will learn healthy ways to manage the physiological,
social and emotional changes in their growing years. They learn to build
healthy and rewarding relationships with others, including those with members
of the opposite sex. Students are also guided to make wise, informed and
responsible decisions to keep themselves safe from sexuality-related risks.</p>
<p><strong>Information for Parents</strong>
</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents may opt their children
out of Sexuality Education lessons, and/or supplementary Sexuality Education
programmes by MOE-approved external providers.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents who wish to opt their
children out of the Sexuality Education lessons need to complete an opt-out
form via Parent Gateway. This form will be communicated to parents at the
start of the year. The completed opt-out form is to be submitted by 31/04/2025.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents can contact the
school at Ms Noradlina via email at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">noradlina_mohamed@schools.gov.sg</a> for
discussion or to seek clarification about the school’s Sexuality Education
programme.</p>
