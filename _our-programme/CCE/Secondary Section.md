<p>The Student Development Team plans and implements our 10-year Marcellin
Way programme to achieve our Marist student outcomes.&nbsp; The Marcellin
Way, anchored on Marist values and the Marist style of education, are experiences
that seek to build the character of Marists.&nbsp; These values and qualities
were expressed in the life and experiences of Saint Marcellin Champagnat
who started the Marist Brothers in 1817.&nbsp; The effort and perseverance
of our school’s founder Brother Chanel Soon and our early pioneers are
immortalised in our school motto&nbsp;&nbsp;勤 &nbsp;&nbsp;勉 &nbsp;&nbsp;忠
&nbsp;&nbsp;勇. Our Marist values and school motto continue to be relevant
in an ever-changing and dynamic world. They define our philosophy, beliefs
and approach to education. We teach our students with and about compassion
and love, the cornerstone of our Catholic faith.&nbsp; Indeed, the Marcellin
Way programme promotes in our students a life of Faith, Vision and Service
to others.</p>
<p>There are two main programmes, namely Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE) and Faith Formation. Through these two programmes, the authentic
learning experiences aim to inculcate values and build competencies that
will mould Marists to be good individuals, with the tenacity and adaptability
to navigate the unknown future, and who are of service within school and
the wider community.</p>
<p>To achieve these goals, the following programmes are offered:</p>
<p><strong><u>CCE Curriculum</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The CCE curriculum consists both weekly class-based CCE lessons, as well
as key Student Development Experiences, which provide students with rich
and authentic opportunities for CCE beyond the classroom.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>VIA experiences aim to develop Marists to become socially responsible
citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning
and application of values, knowledge and skills via service activities
and VIA project learning experiences.</p>
<p>To give greater focus to students acquiring values through service, Marists
are encouraged to identify and understand the community issues, and initiate
action among their peers to make a difference and improve the lives of
others.</p>
<p>To provide opportunities for Marists to engage with various community
sectors, each level has a different focus and experience:</p>
<p><strong>Sec 1: Partnership with St. Theresa’s Home</strong>
</p>
<p>Sec 1 students have the opportunity to plan interactive activities with
the elderly and also support the home in cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>Sec 2: Partnership with Geylang East Home for the Aged and St. Luke Eldercare</strong>
</p>
<p>Sec 2 students have the opportunity to plan interactive activities, and
most classes will also showcase what they have learned in Appreciation
of Chinese Culture (ACC) lessons by putting up a festive drum performance
for the seniors. Some classes will visit Geylang East Home for the Aged,
while others will host seniors from St. Luke Eldercare in school.</p>
<p><strong>Sec 3: Class-initiated projects with various community sectors</strong>
</p>
<p>Sec 3 students have the autonomy to decide the community sector they would
like to support. They are responsible for planning and executing the projects,
with support and guidance from their Form Teachers. Past projects include
supporting Willing Hearts, Al Islah Mosque during the month of Ramadan,
and supporting the Blessing in Harmony initiative in Punggol.</p>
<p><strong>Sec 4: Class-initiated projects with various community sectors</strong>
</p>
<p>Sec 4 students are encouraged to continue their partnership with the community
organization they supported in Sec 3. Some may decide to pursue other opportunities
to help.</p>

<summary><strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Education and career guidance aims to nurture Marists’ self-awareness,
self-directedness, and life skills to set realistic goals and continually
learn and add value in their future workplace. It also enables Marists
to explore viable education and career options through discussions of industry
trends and developments in ECG lessons.</p>
<p>Key ECG experiences include the ECG Talk and Sharing, where our alumni
return to school and share their ECG journey in secondary school, post-secondary
education, and careers with our Sec 2 and Sec 4 students. The speakers
focus on how they navigated these important moments in their lives. Selected
Sec 3 Marists will take part in the job shadowing program, where they get
to follow professionals at their workplace for 5 days and learn more about
the skills they need in the work environment.</p>

<summary><strong>Cyber Wellness Education</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Cyber Wellness Education focuses on the well-being of Marists as they
navigate cyberspace, helping them to be responsible digital learners. The
curriculum aims to equip them with the knowledge and skills to harness
the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in
cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT.
<br>In addition to in-class lessons and discussions, the student leaders,
who are also advocates of cyber wellness, organise school-wide sharings
and activities to promote cyber wellness among their peers.</p>

<summary><strong>Cohort Camps</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>A key boy-centric experience for all Marists is the Cohort Camps. Camps&nbsp;
promote self-discovery and are good platforms for Marists to step out of
their comfort zone, develop teamwork, resilience, and adaptability. The
focus of each camp is different, tailored to meet the needs of Marists
at each developmental stage. The Cohort Camps utilise a kinaesthetic boy-centric
approach to ensure optimised learning. Secondary 3 Marists go through the
nation-wide MOE Outward Bound Singapore (OBS) Challenge Programme, which
provides them with the opportunity to interact with peers from other schools.
Secondary 4 Marists go through a Youth Commitment Workshop to strengthen
their mindset to overcome setbacks and motivate themselves towards success,
equipping them with personal and life skills important for their future
pathways.</p>

<summary><strong>Student Leadership</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>At MSHS, we believe that all Marists can be a leader based on his unique
blend of abilities, dispositions and talents. As such, we belief that every
Marist should be developed as a leader, to have the confidence and initiative
to manage himself and make a positive difference to others, the community
and the nation.</p>
<p>All Marist Student Leaders are encouraged to develop their leadership
skills in order to support fellow students and to benefit the wider community.
Opportunities to develop these qualities are provided through a range of
learning experiences, both in their everyday school life and in targeted
leadership programmes encouraging students to build their own sense of
themselves as leaders keeping Marist values central.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our student leaders are called to action each day, by being firmly grounded
in the Marist values and the five practices of exemplary leadership, as
Values-Driven, Service-Oriented Leaders of Faith, Vision and Service.</p>

<summary><strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools
aims to enable students to understand the physiological, social and emotional
changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex, and make
wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised
on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means
encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units
with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based
on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious
communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality
Education are to:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support
students in managing their physiological, social and emotional changes
as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guide students
to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help students
develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others by having
positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that are premised
on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love and respect
yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build positive
relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong
families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make responsible
decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstinence before
marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies.
Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of Maris Stella High School’s Sexuality Education Programme for 2026</strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education is delivered
in a holistic manner through the school curriculum. The content for Sexuality
Education is grouped into five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal
Relationships, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and
Law. You may click <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.) for more
information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subjects that incorporate topics
on sexuality include:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Science</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education Lessons</u></strong>:</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The values and attitudes of our
youth towards sexuality are increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure
to the media, popular culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex
stage in life as the adolescent attempts to find his or her own identity
and often struggles with new social relationships. The period of middle
adolescence (generally from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period
for adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity
may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various activities
(including sexual activities), sometimes without understanding the unpleasant
consequences that may arise from such experimentation. The need for peer
acceptance can be overwhelmingly strong and hinder one’s ability to act
responsibly.&nbsp; Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent from
within themselves and from peers, it is important to build a strong sense
of self-worth, personal conviction and an understanding of the possible
consequences of sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the Sexuality Education
lessons, secondary students will have the opportunity to develop a positive
self-esteem, develop their character, and expand their understanding and
repertoire of skills to deal with various issues related to sexuality,
which are of prime concern at this age.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>At Maris Stella High School, the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in <u>2026</u>: <a href="/files/Sexuality Education/Secondary/MSHS_SED_Lessons_2026.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2026 Sexuality Education Lessons in CCE</a></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em><u>eTeens</u></em><u> Programme</u></strong>:</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>eTeens</em> is a programme that
was developed by Health Promotion Board, in collaboration with the Ministry
of Education, to provide Secondary 3 students with accurate information
on STIs, HIV and protection from a health perspective. With the formation
of the Communicable Diseases Agency (CDA) on 1 April 2025, the programme
would now be managed by CDA’s Training and Education Division instead of
HPB. <em>eTeens</em> is conducted in two segments – a mass talk segment and
a classroom-based programme. The desired outcome of the <em>eTeens</em> programme
is that students are empowered to make wise, informed and sensible decisions
to protect themselves from sexually transmitted infectious diseases.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are taught skills such
as decision-making, assertiveness and negotiation to say “no” to sex and
negative peer pressure. They also learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends
beyond themselves and involves their family, and the importance of responsible
decision-making and seeking help. Abstinence and upholding family values
are the key messages.</p>
<p><strong>At Maris Stella High School, the <em>eTeens</em> programme will be implemented as follows in 2026:</strong>
